# anchor_verify_demo — regression test for `verify_anchors.py`

End-to-end check that the anchor-based content verifier catches the four
failure modes it's designed to catch. Self-asserting — exits nonzero on any
mismatch.

## What it does

1. Generates a 2-sample samplesheet (TSV) pointing at two real COLO829 ONT BAMs.
2. Calls `verify_anchors.py generate` to freeze `samtools view -c` counts
   into `anchors.hg38.tsv` (the regression fixture).
3. Calls `build_igvreports.py --samplesheet ... --no-verify` to produce
   `reports/sample_{1,2}.hg38.html` + `index.html`.
4. Runs `verify_anchors.py verify-cohort` against the clean cohort (all PASS).
5. Runs four corruption scenarios, each asserting the expected outcome:

   | Scenario | Corruption | Expected |
   |---|---|---|
   | A | Mutate anchors `expected` to 9999 (real ~56) | `sample_1/chr2/FAIL` (diff_ratio) |
   | B | Set anchor `min=1000` (real ~56) | `sample_1/chr2/FAIL` (min bound) |
   | C | Mangle a session's base64 payload (`H4sI` → `XXXX`) | `sample_1/*/FAIL` (decode), sample_2 PASS |
   | D | Drop an anchor row | row absent from output, others PASS |

6. Cleans up generated `reports/`, samplesheet, sites BED, anchors TSVs, and
   `logs/` on exit (set `KEEP_REPORTS=1` to leave them).

## Run

```bash
bash tests/integration/anchor_verify/scenarios.sh
```

Or as part of the full test suite:

```bash
bash tests/run_all.sh                  # all layers
bash tests/run_all.sh --integration-only
```

Runtime: **~6-8 min cold** (the cohort build dominates); **~15 s** when the
cohort is cached. Set `REBUILD=1` to force a rebuild of the HTMLs; otherwise
existing HTMLs in `reports/` are reused so verifier iteration is seconds.

Disk: ~10 MB temp under `reports/`, auto-cleaned via `trap`.

## Why these scenarios

The four scenarios cover every status the verifier emits:

- **PASS** (scenario 0): observed within tolerance of expected, or within
  `min`/`max` bounds.
- **FAIL — tolerance** (A): observed read count differs from expected beyond
  the per-row tolerance (default 5%). Catches the silent sample-swap case
  where the wrong source BAM was wired into the build pipeline — same track
  name, different read counts.
- **FAIL — bound** (B): `min`/`max` columns let you assert "this integration
  site should have ≥20 reads supporting it" — a stronger claim than
  tolerance, useful for known-positive sites.
- **FAIL — broken decode** (C): the HTML's session entry can't be gunzipped
  or its inner BAM data URL can't be base64-decoded. Catches arbitrary HTML
  tampering or `create_report` version drift that breaks the embedding format.
- **SKIP** (D): an anchor row references a `(sample, region)` pair that the
  HTML doesn't render. Dropped silently because anchor TSVs are intentionally
  re-usable across runs — a region that exists in one cohort's anchors but
  not in another cohort's HTMLs is benign, not a build failure.

## BAM paths (parameterized)

Defaults to MSKCC HPC paths for the COLO829 ONT BAMs. Override per BAM via
env vars when running elsewhere:

```bash
IGV_REPORTS_TEST_BAM_1=/path/to/sample1.bam \
IGV_REPORTS_TEST_BAM_2=/path/to/sample2.bam \
    bash tests/integration/anchor_verify/scenarios.sh
```

The verifier doesn't care which BAMs, only that they're different so
scenarios A-C have the contrast they need. If a default doesn't exist and
no env override is set, the script exits **77** (POSIX skipped-test
convention) and `run_all.sh` reports it as a skip, not a failure.

## Why this is `integration`, not `smoke` or `unit`

This test depends on real BAMs and on `create_report` actually running, so
it can't fit in `tests/smoke/` (which uses only the committed COLO829 slice
fixture and runs in seconds) or `tests/unit/` (parser-only, no I/O).
