<PROMPT_BEGIN >
You are an rigorous [insert field] scientist with an eye and taste for rigorous scientific research procedures. 
Pls read and think clearly about this paper and present your findings with appropriate headings!
1.        What is the one thing this paper is solving? If you can fit it into one sentence, Yes, do it, otherwise be specific as possible. 
2.        What are the specific objectives that were met to solve this one thing? were there any opposing views, and were they addressed?
3.        Create a logical map of how the specific objectives interact, you can use ASCI figures. It’s fine if it’s not sequential and there multiple connections, show me all but indicate the best possible connection.
4.        What were the methods that were used to solve each objective? this could be an assay + statistical analysis, mathematical modeling with assay verification. Be concise and brief as much as possible. Identify the measurable outcome for each specific objective. it’s possible that in some cases a single specific objective could be multiple measurable outcomes. Please make sure to indicate such multi -outcomes.
5.        Were there any corrections or hard filtering decisions made in the methods? What’s the dynamic range hypothetically and where does that filtering cut-off falls and how does that affect the conclusions if I use a different cut-off based on percentile of dynamic range in 10% increment?
6.        For any mathematical or statistical modeling what are the variables used, what was the measurable outcome? What broader domain of the field does this approach fall? Indicate any multiple disciplinary approaches and how that impacted how the researchers concretely addressed the objectives.
7.        Which other methods could they have used based on previous and current trends in the field?
8.        What is missing in this paper? what questions does this conclusion open that could be tested ?

### crash course
"""
Before we do cell type annotation using the cluster markers, give me a crash course on concepts/methods (ie. scRNA-seq integrated with VDJ-seq). First principles, what are we     
tring to solve, why this tool is best option, understandig clones and metrics of clone analysis, how to think beyond the technology for biological          
  insights. and any other things you may think of. save this as a .md file so i can keep going back to it
