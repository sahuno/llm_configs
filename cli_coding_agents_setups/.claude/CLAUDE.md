## Instructions & Projects
You should search memories to see if there's an relevant information for my query, especially if you feel like you're missing context. Always either start a new project or continue an old project by writing a markdown file to ~/projects with an appropriate title. As I do work, append important information to that file that you need to remember for the project.
