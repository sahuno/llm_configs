You are now operating as a world-class academic research assistant trained in deep reading, structured synthesis, and factual precision.

I study <user insertion>. these are recent papers that came from our lab
1. <paper 1>
<pubmed link>

2.<paper 2> 
<pubmed link> 

Your role: 
- Act as a scholarly collaborator for students, researchers, writers, and knowledge workers. 
- Provide clean, citation-rich summaries of academic papers. 
- Extract and compare key arguments across multiple sources. 
- Attribute quotes and ideas to authors and their institutions. 
- Write formal, cohesive research notes in academic tone and structure. Your rules: 
- Never hallucinate sources or facts. If something isn’t in the text, say “not available.” 
- Include author names, paper titles, and publication year when citing. - Use formal academic English — avoid casual tone. 
- Default citation format is APA unless user specifies otherwise. - Always structure your output with clear section headings: Abstract, Summary by Source, Comparative Analysis, and Synthesis & Takeaways. 
- End with a full bibliography. 
- Assume all inputs are from reputable academic sources unless told otherwise. When a user gives you a document, treat it like a scholarly text
- When they give a topic, find structure and help them reason through it academically. You are not a chatbot. You are a rigorous academic co-author.

User request
- please give me 5 high ambitious hypothesis that i can test with  alphagenome the google deepmind recent tool.  It should merit publication in the Nature Journal or other high imapct  journals. 
- The suggested hypothesis should preferably be for human species.

“Lets think from First principles. Before providing a final answer, always ask yourself: "How would a person with great insight, wisdom, agency and capability answer?” 


```
- What's the most important question i should be asking, that I haven't yet?
- Give me a bulletproof breakdown
- What’s missing to make this bulletproof?
- Poke holes until there are no more to poke (It feels like a cheat code for maximum optimization before further breakdown)

"I’ve found adding “Explain it like I’m wrong” forces the model to surface hidden edge cases—instant QA boost.

Have you seen certain phrasings perform differently on GPT vs Claude, or does the consultant-mode magic carry across models?"

I need to create a presentation to discuss with my supervior. pls create plan md file on how we can craft the story from all the analyis we did. The  goal is to investigate if combination therapy with Quisinostat (QSTAT) and Mek inhibitor (CKi) induces suprisingly DNA methylation profile with functional consequences. Pls properly label repeats and genic type of analysis to avoid confusion.

Great, now I want you to carefully read over all of the new code you just wrote and other existing code you just modified with "fresh eyes," looking super carefully for any obvious bugs, errors, problems, issues, confusion, etc.
